What is Mechanics Academy?
==========================


At its heart, Mechanics Academy aims to be a comprehensive resource
for anyone interested in learning mechanics. The project:

* Serves as a device to attract new learners to a rich and useful
  topic

  * Hands-on simulation to demonstrate application potential and
    motivate theory

* Acts as a catalogue of high-quality learning resources for mechanics

  * Catalogue great existing Open Educational Resources
  * Fill gaps defined by necessary competencies with original course
    content

* Provides a community of co-learners and mechanics experts to
  approach for help while learning

  * Conversely, provides experts experience with mentorship

* Contains mechanisms to test learning and gauge competency

* Acts as a conduit between a community with certain competency and
  employers who require it

In addition, it benefits me personally in the following ways:

* Serves as a sophisticated web-based service to expand and exercise
  my web development and design skill-set

* Provides me an opportunity to build and exercise my teaching skills

  * Includes mechanisms for experimentation with different teaching
    (and learning motivation) methodologies, and uses analytics to
    refine pedagogy

* Serves as an advertising tool to establish myself as deeply
  knowledgeable about mechanics and its education
